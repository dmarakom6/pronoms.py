IMPORTANT!
----------

IF YOU WANT TO RUN THIS CODE ON WINDOWS, MAKE SURE BOTH FILES IN THE /WIN/ DIRECTORY ARE
PLACED IN THE SAME FOLDER AFTER DOWNLOAD.
FIRST FILE TO RUN: pronoms.allow.exe

THIS PUTS THE MAIN FILE INTO YOUR ANTIVIRUS' WHITELIST
THEN RUN THE MAIN FILE: pronoms.exe

IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS DEFENDER AS YOUR MAIN ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE, IGNORE THE POP-UP BY PRESSING
THE "MORE DETAILS" BUTTON, THEN "RUN ANYWAY".

**MOST ANTIVIRUSES WILL NOT CONSIDER THE .EXE AS A VIRUS, BUT WINDOWS DEFENDER WILL.
