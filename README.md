Perfect for verb exercises and pronoun revisions.

## Linux
Requirements: python3
Run pronoms.sh by doing `python3 pronoms.sh`
> Note: `pronoms.sh` must be in the same directory when the above command is called.

## Windows
Requirements: No terrible antivirus software (That goes for you, Microsoft)
Disable your antivirus to run the app once, if it considers `pronoms.exe` a virus.
For Windows Defender users, run the second executable first, then Defender will allow the program to run.
